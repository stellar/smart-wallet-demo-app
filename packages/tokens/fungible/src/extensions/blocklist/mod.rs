/// BlockList Trait for Fungible Token
///
/// The `FungibleBlockList` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to
/// provide a blocklist mechanism that can be managed by an authorized account.
/// This extension ensures that blocked accounts cannot transfer tokens or
/// approve token transfers.
///
/// The blocklist provides the guarantee to the contract owner that any blocked
/// account won't be able to execute transfers or approvals.
///
/// This trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `FungibleToken`
/// trait.
///
/// **NOTE**
///
/// All setter functions, exposed in the `FungibleBlockList` trait, include an
/// additional parameter `operator: Address`. This account is the one
/// authorizing the invocation. Having it as a parameter grants the flexibility
/// to introduce simple or complex role-based access controls.
///
/// However, this parameter is omitted from the module functions, defined in
/// "storage.rs", because the authorizations are to be handled in the access
/// control helpers or directly implemented.
