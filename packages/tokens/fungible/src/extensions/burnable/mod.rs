/// conjunction with the `FungibleToken` trait.

/// this `FungibleBurnable` trait along with the `[FungibleToken]` trait.
/// SEP-41 mandates support for token burning to be considered compliant.

/// Excluding the `burn` functionality from the `[FungibleToken]` trait
/// is a deliberate design choice to accommodate flexibility and customization
/// for various smart contract use cases.
