/// Based on the extension, some default behavior of [`crate::FungibleToken`]
/// might have to be overridden. This is a helper trait that allows us this
/// override mechanism that favors the DevX.
///
/// One can also override the `FungibleToken` trait directly, but the reason
/// we have another helper trait for the same methods, is to provide the default
/// implementations in an easier way for the developers.
///
/// The way to provide different default implementations for different
/// extensions is by implementing the trait for different types (unit structs).
/// The problem is, `FungibleToken` trait has to be implemented for the smart
/// contract (which is another struct) by the developers. So, we need a level
/// of abstraction by introducing an associated type, which will grant
/// `FungibleToken` trait the ability to switch between different default
/// implementations by calling the methods on this associated type.
///
/// By introducing this abstraction, we allow the developers to implement
/// every method of the `FungibleToken` trait using
/// `Self::ContractType::{function_name}`, which will in turn use either the
/// overridden or the base variant according to the extension, provided by the
/// `ContractOverrides` trait implementation for the respective `ContractType`.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```rust
/// impl FungibleToken for ExampleContract {
///     type ContractType = Base;
///
///     fn balance(e: &Env, account: Address) -> i128 {
///         Self::ContractType::balance(e, &account)
///     }
///
///     fn transfer(e: &Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
///         Self::ContractType::transfer(e, &from, &to, amount);
///     }
///
///     /* and so on */
/// }
/// ```
///
/// or the type can be used directly (in this case `Base`)
/// instead of referring to it as `Self::ContractType`:
///
/// ```rust
/// impl FungibleToken for ExampleContract {
///     type ContractType = Base;
///
///     fn balance(e: &Env, account: Address) -> i128 {
///         Base::balance(e, &account)
///     }
///
///     fn transfer(e: &Env, from: Address, to: Address, amount: i128) {
///         Base::transfer(e, &from, &to, amount);
///     }
///
///     /* and so on */
/// }
/// ```
