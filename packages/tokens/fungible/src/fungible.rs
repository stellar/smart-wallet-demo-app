/// Vanilla Fungible Token Trait
///
/// The `FungibleToken` trait defines the core functionality for fungible
/// tokens, adhering to SEP-41. It provides a standard interface for managing
/// balances, allowances, and metadata associated with fungible tokens.
/// Additionally, this trait includes the `total_supply()` function, which is
/// not part of SEP-41 but is commonly used in token contracts.
///
/// To fully comply with the SEP-41 specification one has to implement the
/// `FungibleBurnable` trait in addition to this one. SEP-41 mandates support
/// for token burning to be considered compliant.
///
/// Event for `mint` is defined, but `mint` function itself is not included
/// as a method in this trait because it is not a part of the SEP-41 standard,
/// the function signature may change depending on the implementation.
///
/// We do provide a function [`crate::Base::mint`] for minting to cover the
/// general use case.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To not confuse the developers, we did not provide
/// the default implementations here, but we are providing a macro to generate
/// them.
///
/// When implementing [`NonFungibleToken`] trait for your Smart Contract,
/// you can follow the below example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl FungibleToken for MyContract {
///     ContractType = {Your Contract Type Here};
///
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This trait is implemented for the following Contract Types:
/// * [`crate::Base`] (covering the vanilla case, and compatible with
///   [`crate::extensions::burnable::FungibleBurnable`]) trait
/// * [`crate::extensions::allowlist::AllowList`] (enabling the compatibility
///   and overrides for [`crate::extensions::allowlist::FungibleAllowList`])
///   trait, incompatible with [`crate::extensions::blocklist::BlockList`]
///   trait.
/// * [`crate::extensions::blocklist::BlockList`] (enabling the compatibility
///   and overrides for [`crate::extensions::blocklist::FungibleBlockList`])
///   trait, incompatible with [`crate::extensions::allowlist::AllowList`]
///   trait.
///
/// You can find the default implementations of this trait for `Base`,
/// `Allowlist`, and `Blocklist` by navigating to:
/// `ContractType::{method_name}`. For example, if you want to find how
/// [`FungibleToken::transfer`] is implemented for the `Allowlist` contract
/// type, you can find it using
/// [`crate::extensions::allowlist::AllowList::transfer`].
pub trait FungibleToken {

  /// base trait based on the extensions implemented. You should use
  /// [`crate::Base`] as the type if you are not using
