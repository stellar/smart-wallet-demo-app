/// Burnable Trait for Non-Fungible Token
///
/// The `NonFungibleBurnable` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to
/// provide the capability to burn tokens. This trait is designed to be used in
/// conjunction with the `NonFungibleToken` trait.
///
/// Excluding the `burn` functionality from the
/// [`crate::non_fungible::NonFungibleToken`] trait is a deliberate design
/// choice to accommodate flexibility and customization for various smart
/// contract use cases.
///
/// `storage.rs` file of this module provides the `NonFungibelBurnable` trait
/// implementation for the `Base` contract type. For other contract types (eg.
/// `Enumerable`, `Consecutive`), the overrides of the `NonFungibleBurnable`
/// trait methods can be found in their respective `storage.rs` file.
///
/// This approach lets us to implement the `NonFungibleBurnable` trait in a very
/// flexible way based on the `ContractType` associated type from
/// `NonFungibleToken`:
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl NonFungibleBurnable for ExampleContract {
///     fn burn(e: &Env, from: Address, token_id: u32) {
///         Self::ContractType::burn(e, &from, token_id);
///     }
///
///     fn burn_from(e: &Env, spender: Address, from: Address, token_id: u32) {
///         Self::ContractType::burn_from(e, &spender, &from, token_id);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To not confuse the developers, we did not provide
/// the default implementations here, but we are providing a macro to generate
/// the default implementations for you.
///
/// When implementing [`NonFungibleBurnable`] trait for your Smart Contract,
/// you can follow the below example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl NonFungibleBurnable for MyContract {
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
