/// Royalties Trait for Non-Fungible Token (ERC2981)
///
/// The `NonFungibleRoyalties` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to
/// provide the capability to set and query royalty information for tokens. This
/// trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `NonFungibleToken`
/// trait.
///
/// This implementation follows the ERC2981 standard for royalties, allowing:
/// - Setting global royalties for the entire collection
/// - Setting per-token royalties that override the global setting
///
/// `storage.rs` file of this module provides the `NonFungibleRoyalties` trait
/// implementation.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To avoid confusion, we do not provide the default
/// implementations here, but we are providing a macro that generates them.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl NonFungibleRoyalties for MyContract {
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
