/// # Arguments
///
/// * `bucket` - A vector of `u32`s, where each value is treated as a bitfield.
/// * `start` - The starting bit index to search from, relative to the MSB of
///   the whole bucket.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Some(index)` - The bit index (relative to the entire bucket) of the first
///   set bit found.
/// * `None` - If `start` is out of range, or no set bit is found from that
///   position onwards.
///
/// # Example
///
/// If `IDS_IN_ITEM = 8`, `ITEMS_IN_BUCKET = 2`, and:
/// ```
/// bucket = vec![0b00000000, 0b00101000];
/// ```
/// then `find_bit_in_bucket(bucket, 8)` returns `Some(10)`, since bit 3 of the
/// second item (index 10 in the overall bucket) is the first set bit.
