/// Vanilla NonFungible Token Trait
///
/// The `NonFungibleToken` trait defines the core functionality for non-fungible
/// tokens. It provides a standard interface for managing
/// transfers and approvals associated with non-fungible tokens.
///
/// Event for `mint` is defined, but `mint` function itself is not included
/// as a method in this trait because it is not a part of the standard,
/// the function signature may change depending on the implementation.
///
/// We do provide a function [`crate::Base::sequential_mint`] for sequential
/// minting, and [`crate::Base::mint`] for non-sequential minting strategies.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To not confuse the developers, we did not provide
/// the default implementations here, but we are providing a macro to generate
/// the default implementations for you.
///
/// When implementing [`NonFungibleToken`] trait for your Smart Contract,
/// you can follow the below example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl NonFungibleToken for MyContract {
///     ContractType = {Your Contract Type Here};
///
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This trait is implemented for the following Contract Types:
/// * [`crate::Base`] (covering the vanilla case, and compatible with
///   [`crate::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`]) trait
/// * [`crate::extensions::enumerable::Enumerable`] (enabling the compatibility
///   and overrides for
///   [`crate::extensions::enumerable::NonFungibleEnumerable`]) trait,
///   incompatible with [`crate::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`])
///   and [`crate::extensions::consecutive::NonFungibleConsecutive`] trait.
/// * [`crate::extensions::consecutive::Consecutive`] (enabling the
///   compatibility and overrides for
///   [`crate::extensions::consecutive::NonFungibleConsecutive`]) trait,
///   incompatible with [`crate::extensions::burnable::NonFungibleBurnable`])
///   and [`crate::extensions::enumerable::NonFungibleEnumerable`] trait.
///
/// You can find the default implementations of this trait for `Base`,
/// `Enumerable`, and `Consecutive`, by navigating to:
/// `ContractType::{method_name}`. For example, if you want to find how
/// [`NonFungibleToken::transfer`] is implemented for the `Enumerable` contract
/// type, you can find it using
/// [`crate::extensions::enumerable::Enumerable::transfer`].
