/// High-level trait for contract upgrades.
///
/// This trait defines the external entry point and can be used in two ways:
///
/// 1. Standalone – Implement this trait directly when full control over access
///    control and upgrade logic is required. In this case, the implementor is
///    responsible for ensuring:
///    - Proper authorization of the `operator`
///    - Versioning management
///
/// 2. Framework-assisted usage – When using the lightweight upgrade framework
///    provided in this module, you should NOT manually implement this trait.
///    Instead:
///    - Derive it using `#[derive(Upgradeable)]`
///    - Provide access control by implementing [`UpgradeableInternal`] with
///      your custom logic
